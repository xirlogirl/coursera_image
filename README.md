This repository contains some of the programming assignments for the Image processing course on Coursera.
"From Mars to Hollywood with a stop at the Hospital: Image and Video Processing"
https://www.coursera.org/learn/image-processing

Note that the assignments for this course were optional, so this repo has only a few that I had time to complete (while I was working full time!)
