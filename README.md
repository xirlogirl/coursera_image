This repository contains some of the (optional) programming assignments for the Image processing course on Coursera.
"From Mars to Hollywood with a stop at the Hospital: Image and Video Processing"

The course was mostly taught with MATLAB demos, but I tried to do the assigments in MATLAB and Python when I had the chance.
